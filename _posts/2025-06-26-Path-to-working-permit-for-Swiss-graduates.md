### Swiss education

Most Swiss public universities charge symbolically low tuition — typically CHF 500–730 per semester 
(e.g. University of Geneva CHF 500[^unige]; EPFL CHF 730[^epfl]) because their operating costs are 
overwhelmingly covered by taxpayers: in the latest breakdown some 80 % of cantonal-university budgets come 
from the Confederation and the cantons (only about 19 % from private sources[^eurydice]).  Federal spending alone on 
education, research & innovation is slated to reach CHF 29.2 billion for the 2025-28 cycle[^eri]. 
  
Seen from that investment perspective, simplifying work-permit rules for foreign graduates is a logical way to 
keep the highly skilled people Switzerland has already subsidised — turning public outlay on near-free degrees 
into talent retained for the Swiss economy.

### Labour-market test

Switzerland sits in the middle of Europe yet stays **outside the EU**, pairing a high-wage, high-skill economy 
with decidedly protectionist rules for its domestic labour pool: EU/EFTA nationals enjoy near-automatic access 
via the Free-Movement Agreement (FMP), but third-country nationals face quotas and a strict **“Swiss/EU first” 
principle**[^FMP].  

The Swiss **labour-market test** (“Vorrangprüfung”) operationalises that principle: an employer must show **no suitably 
qualified Swiss or EU/EFTA worker is available** before hiring a third-country national. The vacancy is advertised 
publicly (≈ 3 weeks), a search report lists every local applicant and rejection reason, the salary is benchmarked 
against Swiss norms, and the cantonal quota account is debited once the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) 
signs off — failure at any point blocks the L- or B-permit [^FNIA] [^Weisungen4].  

Exemptions include **Swiss-educated graduates** (Art. 21 para. 3 FNIA), intra-group transferees, short assignments ≤ 4 
months and hardship/public-interest cases; these bypass the test but — until the pending amendment passes — 
**still consume a quota unit**.

### Exemption for Swiss-educated graduates  

Where the labour-market test is the general gatekeeper, Switzerland makes one big carve-out: **Art. 21 para. 
3 FNIA** lets non-EU graduates of Swiss universities bypass that test altogether, provided the job is of *“overriding scientific or economic interest.”*[^FNIA]  
The Act states the **principle**; the **practice** is laid out almost entirely in the federal SEM directives:

| Instrument (beyond the Act)                                                       | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SEM *Weisungen AIG* (full PDF)**[^Weisungen]                                    | Implements Art. 21 § 3 FNIA in day-to-day administration: issues a **six-month L-permit** for job search immediately after graduation, allows up to **15 h per week** of ancillary work during that period, and lets the canton convert the L straight to a **B-permit** once you present a contract that meets the “overriding interest” test. |
| **SEM *Weisungen AIG*, Chapter 4 “Residence with gainful activity”**[^Weisungen4] | Operational guide for cantonal case-workers: spells out what counts as a *“Swiss higher-education degree,”* lists the documents that prove *scientific/economic interest,* and names every required form, CV, and bank statement.                                                                                                               |

Taken together, **Art. 21 § 3 FNIA** (principle) and the **SEM Weisungen** (detail) tell you not only **that** the 
graduate exemption exists, but **exactly how to use it in practice**.

> **How Swiss migration law is layered**  
> 1. **Act (Gesetz)** – adopted by Parliament, subject to optional referendum.  
> 2. **Directives / Weisungen** – issued by the competent federal office (here the SEM); they bind the cantonal authorities and provide line-by-line instructions and examples.

### Quotas still apply – even for the graduates

Art. 21 para. 3 FNIA lets Swiss-educated third-country graduates skip the labour-market test, **but it does not 
free them from the annual quotas** that Switzerland imposes on non-EU/EFTA workers.  

*Each year the Federal Council sets a single national ceiling for L- (short stay) and B- (residence) permits, 
then allocates the bulk of the quota to cantons and keeps the remainder centrally. Every canton keeps a “quota account”; 
when the State  Secretariat for Migration (SEM) approves an L or B permit, one unit is debited. If a canton runs out, 
it can request extra units from the federal reserve. Unused quotas expire at year-end.*

**Not counted:** the six-month **job-search L-permit** you receive right after graduation.  
**Counted:** the regular L or B **work** permit issued once you sign an employment contract, because the draft bill 
**BRG 22.067** that would exempt graduates from quotas is still only a proposal [^BR2021].

> “Admission is subject to the quota, even when the priority rule is waived.”  
> — SEM *Weisungen AIG* § 4.2 (*Höchstzahlen*)[^FNIA]

So, while the graduate exemption removes the biggest hurdle (the labour-market test), you and your employer must 
still ensure a quota place is available in the canton for the year in question.

### Quota exhaustion – what the last decade shows  

The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) publishes a monthly “Monitoring Höchstzahlen” report that shows, 
canton by canton, how many L- and B-units have been used and how many remain.[^SemMonitor]  

Because these data are public, we can track in real time how close Switzerland comes to its ceilings and judge how likely it is that a quota will be exhausted.

| Year     | National ceiling reached?                                    | Reality on the ground                                                                                                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2016** | **Yes – 100 %** of both L- and B-units exhausted in December | Late-year applications were rolled over to January; Zürich, Basel-Stadt and Geneva had already tapped the federal reserve.               |
| **2017** | **Almost** (B 99 %, L 87 %)                                  | Zürich and Geneva ran out of cantonal units in Q1 but were replenished from the federal pool, so filings continued without interruption. |
| **2018** | **Yes** (L 80 %, B 100 %)                                    | National stock of B permits ran out; cantons still had 57 B and 214 L permits left on 31 Dec.                                            |
| **2019** | **No** (L 85 %, B 84 %)                                      | Headroom remained nationwide; 791 B and 1512 L permits carried over into 2020.                                                           |
| **2020** | **No** (L 60 %, B 68 %)                                      | Covid slump: quotas comfortably under-used; 2223 B and 3105 L permits sat in the reserve.                                                |
| **2021** | **No** (L 73 %, B 80 %)                                      | Demand rebounded but every canton still had spare units; 1062 L and 916 B rolled over.                                                   |
| **2022** | **No** (L 80 %, B 91 %)                                      | Strong hiring year, yet all cantons finished with stock and none asked for emergency allocations.                                        |
| **2023** | **No** (L 75 %, B 80 %)                                      | >1400 permits remained in canton accounts and >1300 in the federal reserve at year-end.                                                  |
| **2024** | **No** (L 69 %, B 79 %)                                      | Quotas eased further: cantons still held 357 L and 214 B permits plus 1607 L and 1457 B in the federal pool on 31 Dec.                   |

**Bottom line:** federal quotas have reached the limit exactly **2 times** in ten years, and even then only in the 
final weeks. Local (cantonal) shortages can occur sooner, but extra units are usually granted.  

For a Swiss-educated third-country graduate the practical rule is simple: **submit your work-permit application as 
soon as you have an offer** — the earlier in the calendar year, the smaller the risk of bumping into a full quota.

### What does “Overriding scientific or economic interest” mean?

Even though the national **quotas almost never run out**, a non-EU/EFTA Swiss graduate must still clear a second gate: 
the job itself has to be of *hohem wissenschaftlichem oder wirtschaftlichem Interesse* – “overriding scientific 
or economic interest.”  Cantonal officers apply the three-step yardstick in **SEM Weisungen § 4.4.6** [^Weisungen4]:

1. **Direct link to the Swiss degree** – the role must use the specialist knowledge you gained in Switzerland; generic admin or sales posts do not qualify.  
2. **Demonstrable labour-market need** – officers look at labour shortage indicators.
3. **Added value for Switzerland** – the position should expand R & D capacity, deploy advanced technology, create additional Swiss jobs or bring in new contracts.

**Illustrative green-light roles the Weisungen cite** [^Weisungen4]:

* Executive R & D posts in science, ICT, med-tech, MEM or pharma industries  
* Process-, production-, civil-, electrical- and telecom-engineers; mathematicians & natural scientists  
* Software developers, systems analysts, database & network specialists  
* Specialist physicians, physiotherapists, registered nurses with post-basic training, radiographers  
* University and university-of-applied-sciences lecturers / professors  
* Business-administration experts in management & organisational analysis  

**Take-away:** getting an offer in your study field is **necessary but not sufficient**. Ensure your employer’s cover 
letter names the shortage list or indicator, spells out the technology transfer or innovation the role delivers, and 
quantifies the new Swiss jobs or contracts your hire will unlock.

### Conclusion

For a non-EU/EFTA national, earning your degree in Switzerland is a perfectly legitimate – and often the most 
straightforward – route to a Swiss work permit. The graduate carve-out in Art. 21 § 3 FNIA removes the labour-market 
test, and the national quotas almost never fill up.  

But exemptions on paper don’t erase the real-world hurdles: employers still prize prior experience, 
early-career roles draw ferocious competition from EU talent, and many HR departments simply don’t know the graduate 
rule exists. Navigating that knowledge gap, and the tight Swiss job market, is a story for another day.
