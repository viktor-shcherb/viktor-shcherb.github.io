  My “Hello world” post on why I’m launching this blog for long-form thoughts—plus a teaser on Swiss work-permits for non-EU grads.

# Why bother?

While I don't have a clear use-case for my own website at the moment, there will be moments when 
I will need to share my experience and thoughts that do not really line up with the type of content
on any given social media. This will also give me useful editorial freedom. For example, LinkedIn 
discourages links that go off website, and Twitter/X limits the number of characters. 

You can expect a post here soon on Swiss working permits – what are the challenges for non-EU folks 
and how to stay here after the graduation. 

See you around.
